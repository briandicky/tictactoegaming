Second thread, Player thread, after user type "start" command server will start to execute the tictactoe game. Then this thread will judge the user commands is work or not and win or lose or euqal.

# Client side:
There is two modes that could be chosen, one is p.k. to another user, the other is p.k. AI.
First mode, p.k. to another user, if player click the lattice then it will send the position to server side. Then server side will response some message, including win/lose/equal and who is playing now.
